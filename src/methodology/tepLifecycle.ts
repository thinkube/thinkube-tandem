/**
 * TEP-lifecycle gate (SP-th4wqg / SP-G of TEP-th3i18) — the pure decision layer
 * that closes the ungated TEP→Spec boundary:
 *
 *   - `tepApprovalGate` (SP-th4wqg_SL-1, issue #25) — **approval before build**:
 *     a Spec may be *drafted* while its `implements:` TEP is still `proposed`,
 *     but it can't reach **Ready** until that TEP is `accepted` (=
 *     approved-to-build). The refusal names the TEP and its current status so
 *     the author knows exactly what to accept.
 *
 *   - `tepComplete` (this slice, SP-th4wqg_SL-2, issue #26) — **completeness
 *     from specs**: a TEP is *complete* (delivered) only when **every**
 *     implementing Spec is `accepted`. The result names the still-open Specs so
 *     `get_project` can show what's left, and `writeTep` can refuse a premature
 *     `implemented` status.
 *
 * Pure (no fs / no vscode), so it's unit-testable vscode-free. The actual
 * cross-board resolution of a Spec's `implements:` ref → its TEP's status is the
 * caller's job (`create_slice`'s →Ready path resolves it via board context, like
 * `promoteTep`, then hands the resolved status here). This module only decides
 * **given a ref and the status it resolved to**, may the slice go Ready?
 *
 * The signature here is the contract the `create_slice` wiring and the
 * handler-driven `tepLifecycleDispatch.test.ts` ('approval') both agree on.
